    "h1:title":"Hello There 👋 Welcome to Mesih's JSON Website Generator 🚀",
    "md:info":"Once upon a time, there was a PhD student named Mesih 🤓. He was knee-deep in research, studying the intricacies of bioinformatics 🧬. But as he worked on his manuscript, he found himself facing a common problem among researchers: creating companion websites to showcase his findings.\n\nMesih found himself creating three separate websites for three different manuscripts, and each time he thought to himself, \"there has to be a better way!\" 🤔\n\nSo, being the tech-savvy bioinformatician that he is, Mesih set out to create a website generator that would make it easy for researchers like himself to present their findings in a visually appealing and interactive way 🚀.\n\nHe realized that with JSON, a dictionary-like format, he could represent nearly anything! 🤯 So, he got to work and created the generator you see before you today.\n\nWith this generator, you can easily create tables, charts, and graphs to present your findings in a clear and easy-to-understand format. You can also include interactive elements, such as charts, that allow visitors to explore the data in more depth. 📊📈🔍\n\nNot only that, but you can also use the generator to create pages that provide explanations of key concepts and techniques used in your research. For example, you could include markdown sections with explanations and diagrams to help visitors understand the methods and techniques used in your study.🔬📝\n\nBut that's not all! The generator can also be used for creating portfolios, landing pages, documentation websites, event websites and more. 🚀📊💻\n\nAnd so, with the help of a little bit of coding magic 🧙‍♂️ and a lot of determination, Mesih created a website generator that makes it easy for researchers to present their findings in an interactive and easily accessible format.\n\nHere you are using it, Mesih's creation, a website generator that will make your research presentation a breeze 🌬🌪.",

For example, `md:info:6` creates a markdown section named info and takes up half of the page 🌟.\n\n#####🔥 Two Column Layout\n\nTo create a two-column layout, you'll need to specify the xs property for each element.

        "md:section": "##### Sections\n\nThe `section` tag is a powerful tool that allows you to create custom layouts and organize your elements in a way that makes sense for your specific use case.\n\nFor example, let's say you're creating a bioinformatics website that focuses on the structure and function of a particular protein. You might use the `section` tag to create a section for the protein's sequence, a section for its 3D structure, and a section for any relevant research findings.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use the `section` tag in a json file to create a visually appealing layout for this information:\n\n```json{\n    \"section:sequence\": {\n        \"h2:sequenceTitle\": \"Protein Sequence\",\n        \"seq:testseq:6\": \"MAACCAACAKKV\"\n    },\n    \"section:structure\": {\n        \"h2:structureTitle\": \"3D Structure\",\n        \"pdb:3pqr:6\": {\n            \"path\":\"rcsb://6vsb\",\n            \"height\":\"400px\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"section:findings\": {\n        \"h2:findingsTitle\": \"Research Findings\",\n        \"md:findingsInfo:6\": \"Recent studies have shown that this protein plays a key role in the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus 🦠🔬\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, the `section` tag allows you to create distinct areas on the page for different types of information, and you can use other tags within each section to add elements like headings, sequence, structure, markdown etc.\n\nThis is a powerful way to organize your website and ensure that all the information is presented in a clear and easy-to-understand way 📚💻"
